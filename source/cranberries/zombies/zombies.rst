couplet 1

    | Another head hangs lowly
    | Child is slowly taken
    | And the violence, caused such silence
    | Who are we mistaken?
    | But you see, it's not me
    | It's not my family
    | In your head, in your head, they are fighting
    | With their tanks, and their bombs
    | And their bombs, and their guns
    | In your head, in your head they are crying

refrain

    | In your head, in your head
    | Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
    | What's in your head, in your head
    | Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
    | Do, do, do, do
    | Do, do, do, do
    | Do, do, do, do
    | Do, do, do, do

couplet 2

    | Another mother's breaking
    | Heart is taking over
    | When the violence causes silence
    | We must be mistaken
    | It's the same old theme
    | Since nineteen-sixteen
    | In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
    | With their tanks, and their bombs
    | And their bombs, and their guns
    | In your head, in your head, they are dying
    | In your head, in your head
    | Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
    | What's in your head, in your head
    | Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
    | Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, ay, oh, ya ya
