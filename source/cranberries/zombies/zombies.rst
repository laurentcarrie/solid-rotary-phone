couplet 1

    | Another head hangs lowly
    | Child is slowly taken
    | And the violence, caused such silence
    | Who are we mistaken?
    | But you see, it's not me
    | It's not my family
    | In your head, in your head, they are fighting
    | With their tanks, and their bombs
    | And their bombs, and their guns
    | In your head, in your head they are crying

refrain

	| In your head, in your head
	| Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
	| What's in your head, in your head
	| Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
	| Do, do, do, do
	| Do, do, do, do
	| Do, do, do, do
	| Do, do, do, do

couplet 2

	| Another mother's breaking
	| Heart is taking over
	| When the violence causes silence
	| We must be mistaken
	| It's the same old theme
	| Since nineteen-sixteen
	| In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
	| With their tanks, and their bombs
	| And their bombs, and their guns
	| In your head, in your head, they are dying
	| In your head, in your head
	| Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
	| What's in your head, in your head
	| Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
	| Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, ay, oh, ya ya
