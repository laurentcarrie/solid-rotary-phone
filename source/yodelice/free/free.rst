couplet 1 (g rhytmique seulement)

    | Thank you for pretending that
    | You can see me in the dark
    | As if I was making sense
    | And what I meant is what you really heard

refrain (g,b, d grosse caisse)

    | \'Cause baby baby baby

    | I\'ll be what I wanna be
    | Crazy as it may be
    | I\'ll die when I wanna

couplet

    | Lies set me free
    | Lies keep me from my fear
    | Lies believe in me
    | Lies heavenly shelter

refrain (g rhytmique seule)

    | Thank you for pretending that
    | I don\'t cry and I don'\t care
    | That my heart is made of clay
    | And I will keep sailing away


    | \'Cause baby baby baby
    | I\'ll be what I wanna be
    | Crazy as it may be
    | I\'ll die when I wanna


    | Lies set me free
    | Lies keep me from my fear
    | Liesâ€¦
