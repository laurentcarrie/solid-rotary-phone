<T>Couplet 1</T>
<C>
Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
Your rolled-up sleeves in your skull t-shirt
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
</C>

<T>pré refrain 1</T>
<C>
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore
</C>

<T>refrain 1</T>
<C>
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good
</C>

<T>break batterie</T>

<T>couplet 2</T>
<C>
Upstairs in bed, with my ex-boy
He's in a place, but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
</C>

<T>pré refrain 2</T>
<C>
Run out to meet you, chips and pitta
You say, "When we're married"
'Cause you're not bitter
"There'll be none of him no more"
I cried for you on the kitchen floor
</C>

<T>refrain 2</T>
<C>
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good
</C>

<T>break guitare</T>

<T>couplet 3</T>
<C>
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soap my feet
</C>

<T>pré refrain 3</T>
<C>
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drop and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first
</C>

<T>refrain 3</T>
<C>
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yeah, you know that I'm no good
