    Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt \\
    Your rolled-up sleeves in your skull t-shirt \\
    You say, "What did you do with him today?" \\
    And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray }


    \prerefrain{pré refrain 1}{\\
    'Cause you're my fella, my guy \\
    Hand me your Stella and fly \\
    By the time I'm out the door \\
    You tear me down like Roger Moore}


    \refrain{refrain 1}{\\
    I cheated myself, \\
    Like I knew I would \\
    I told you I was trouble, \\
    You know that I'm no good }

    \couplet{couplet 2}{\\
    Upstairs in bed, with my ex-boy \\
    He's in a place, but I can't get joy \\
    Thinking on you in the final throes \\
    This is when my buzzer goes }



    \prerefrain{pré refrain 2}{\\
    Run out to meet you, chips and pitta \\
    You say, "When we're married" \\
    'Cause you're not bitter \\
    "There'll be none of him no more" \\
    I cried for you on the kitchen floor }

    I cheated myself,\\
    Like I knew I would \\
    I told you I was trouble, \\
    You know that I'm no good }

    Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain \\
    We're like how we were again \\
    I'm in the tub, you on the seat \\
    Lick your lips as I soap my feet}



    \prerefrain{pré refrain 3}{\\
    Then you notice likkle carpet burn \\
    My stomach drop and my guts churn \\
    You shrug and it's the worst \\
    To truly stuck the knife in first }
