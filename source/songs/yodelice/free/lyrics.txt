Thank you for pretending that
You can see me in the dark
As if I was making sense
And what I meant is what you really heard

'Cause baby baby baby

I'll be what I wanna be
Crazy as it may be
I'll die when I wanna

Lies set me free
Lies keep me from my fear
Lies believe in me
Lies heavenly shelter

Thank you for pretending that
I don't cry and I don'\t care
That my heart is made of clay
And I will keep sailing away


'Cause baby baby baby
I'll be what I wanna be
Crazy as it may be
I'll die when I wanna

Lies set me free
Lies keep me from my fear
Liesâ€¦
