    So much on my mind, I think, I think too much \\
    Read between these lines, unspoken weight of words \\
    But time comes to rest when you are by my side, it blurs

    And I will follow where this takes me \\
    And my tomorrows long to be unknown \\
    When all is shaken, be my safety \\
    In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone \\

    Change in every wind \\
    The sands of time don't know our name \\
    Oh, nothing's sure, but surely as we stand \\
    I promise I will stay the same \\
    And I've never seen forever \\
    But I know we'll remain
