        A hot summer night, fell like a net \\
        I've gotta find my baby yet\\
        I need you, to soothe my head\\
        And turn my blue heart to red}

        \couplet{refrain}{\\
        Doctor Doctor, gimme the news\\
        I got a bad case of lovin' you\\
        No pill's gonna cure my ill\\
        I got a bad case of lovin' you}

        \couplet{couplet}{\\
        A pretty face don't make no pretty heart\\
        I learned that buddy from the start\\
        You think I'm cute, a little bit shy\\
        Mama, I ain't that kind of guy}

        \couplet{refrain}{\\
        Doctor Doctor, gimme the news\\
        I got a bad case of lovin' you\\
        No pill's gonna cure my ill\\
        I got a bad case of lovin' you}

        \couplet{pont}{\\
        I know you like it, you like it on top\\
        Tell me mamma, are you gonna stop?}

        \couplet{couplet}{\\
        You had me down twenty-one to zip\\
        Smile of Judas on your lip\\
        Shake my fist, knock on wood\\
        I got it bad, and I got it good}

        \couplet{refrain}{\\
        Doctor Doctor, gimme the news\\
        I got a bad case of lovin' you\\
        No pill's gonna cure my ill\\
        I got a bad case of lovin' you}
