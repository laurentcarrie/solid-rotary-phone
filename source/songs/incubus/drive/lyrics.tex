\couplet{couplet 1}{\\
Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty, stinging clear\\
And I, I can't help but ask myself, how much I let the fear take the wheel and steer}

\couplet{pré-refrain 1}{\\
It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague\\
Haunting mass appeal\\
But lately I'm beginning to find that I\\
Should be the one behind the wheel}

\couplet{refrain 1}{\\
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there\\
With open arms and open eyes, yeah\\
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there\\
I’ll be there, yeah, ohh}


\couplet{couplet 2}{\\
So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive\\
Will I choose water over wine, and hold my own and drive?\\
Ohh-oh-ohh}

\couplet{pré-refrain 2}{\\
It's driven me before, and it seems to be the way\\
That everyone else gets around\\
But lately I'm beginning to find that when I\\
Drive myself my light is found}

\couplet{refrain 2}{\\
And whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there\\
With open arms and open eyes, yeah\\
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there\\
I’ll be there, yeah, ohh}

\couplet{solo guitare}{}

\couplet{pont}{\\
Would you choose the water over wine?\\
Hold the wheel and drive}

\couplet{refrain 3}{\\
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there\\
With open arms and open eyes, yeah\\
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there\\
I’ll be there, yeah, ohh}
