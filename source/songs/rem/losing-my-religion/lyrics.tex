    Oh life, it's bigger\\
    It's bigger than you\\

    I set it up

    Every whisper\\
    Of every waking hour\\
    I'm choosing my confessions\\
    Trying to keep an eye on you\\

    Consider this\\
    Consider this, the hint of the century\\
    Consider this, the slip\\
    That brought me to my knees, failed\\
    What if all these fantasies come\\
    Flailing around\\
    Now I've said too much\\
