<T>couplet 1</T>
<C>
    Oh life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
</C>

<T>couplet 2</T>
<C>
    That's me in the corner
    That's me in the spotlight
    Losing my religion
    Trying to keep up with you
    And I don't know if I can do it
    Oh no, I've said too much
    I haven't said enough

</C>

<T>refrain 1</T>
<C>
    I thought that I heard you laughing
    I thought that I heard you sing
    I think I thought I saw you try

</C>

<T>couplet 3</T>
<C>
    Every whisper
    Of every waking hour
    I'm choosing my confessions
    Trying to keep an eye on you
    Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
    Oh no, I've said too much
    I set it up

</C>
<T>couplet 4</T>
<C>
    Consider this
    Consider this, the hint of the century
    Consider this, the slip
    That brought me to my knees, failed
    What if all these fantasies come
    Flailing around
    Now I've said too much

</C>
<T>refrain 2</T>
<C>
    I thought that I heard you laughing
    I thought that I heard you sing
    I think I thought I saw you try

</C>
<T>break</T>
<C>
    But that was just a dream
    That was just a dream

</C>

<T>couplet 5</T>

<C>
    That's me in the corner
    That's me in the spotlight
    Losing my religion
    Trying to keep up with you
    And I don't know if I can do it
    Oh no, I've said too much
    I haven't said enough

</C>
<T>refrain 3 (double)</T>
<C>
    I thought that I heard you laughing
    I thought that I heard you sing
    I think I thought I saw you try

    But that was just a dream
    Try, cry, why try
    That was just a dream
    Just a dream
    Just a dream, dream
</C>
