I know when to go out \\
Know when to stay in\\
Get things done\\

\couplet{couplet1}{\\
I catch a paper boy\\
But things don't really change\\
I'm standing in the wind\\
But I never wave bye-bye\\
But I try, I try
}


\couplet{couplet 2}{\\
There's no sign of life\\
It's just the power to charm\\
I'm lying in the rain\\
But I never wave bye-bye\\
But I try, I try
}

\refrain{refrain 1}{\\
Never gonna fall for\\
walks beside me\\
(Modern love) walks on by\\
(Modern love) gets me to the church on time\\
(Church on time) terrifies me\\
(Church on time) makes me party\\
(Church on time) puts my trust in God and man\\
(God and man) no confession\\
(God and man) no religion\\
(God and man) don't believe in modern love\\
