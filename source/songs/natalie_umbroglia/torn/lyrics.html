<T>Chorus 1</T>
<C>
    I thought I saw a man brought to life
    He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
    He showed me what it was to cry
    Well you couldn't be that man I adored
    You don't seem to know
    Don't seem to care what your heart is for
    But I don't know him anymore

</C>
<T>Pre-Chorus 1</T>
<C>
    There's nothing where he used to lie
    My conversation has run dry
    That's what's going on
    Nothing's fine 		I'm torn
</C>


<T>Chorus</T>
<C>
    I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
    I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor
    Illusion never changed, into something real
    I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn
    You're a little late, I'm already torn

</C>
<T>Verse 2</T>
<C>
    So I guess the fortune teller's right
    should have seen just what was there and not some holy light
    But you crawl beneath my veins and now

</C>

<T>Pre-Chorus 2</T>
<C>
    I don't care, I have no luck
    I don't miss it all that much
    There's just so many things
    That I can't touch
    I'm torn

</C>
<T>Chorus</T>

<T>Bridge</T>
<C>
Torn...             Ooooh...  Hoo ooooh...  Ooooh
</C>
<T>Pre-Chorus 1</T>
<C>
    There's nothing where he used to lie
    My conversation has run dry
    That's what's going on
    Nothing's fine 		I'm torn

</C>
<T>Chorus</T>
<C>
    I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
    I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor
    Illusion never changed, into something real
    I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn
    I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
    I'm cold and I am shamed, bound and broken on the floor
    You're a little late, I'm already torn

</C>
<T>Outro</T>
<C>
Torn...  (much wailing)
</C>
<T>fade out</T>
<C>
    Fade out: grille du chorus
</C>
