    \couplet{couplet 1}

    I thought I saw a man brought to life \\
    He was warm, he came around like he was dignified \\
    He showed me what it was to cry

    \couplet{couplet 2}
    Well you couldn't be that man I adored \\
    You don't seem to know \\
    Don't seem to care what your heart is for \\
    But I don't know him anymore \\


    \couplet{pré refrain 1}

    There's nothing where he used to lie \\
    My conversation has run dry \\
    That's what's going on \\
    Nothing's fine I'm torn \\



    \couplet{refrain}

    I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel \\
    I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor \\
    Illusion never changed, into something real \\
    I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn \\
    You're a little late, I'm already torn \\

    So I guess the fortune teller's right \\
    should have seen just what was there and not some holy light \\
    But you crawl beneath my veins and now \\



    \couplet{pré refrain 2}

    I don't care, I have no luck \\
    I don't miss it all that much \\
    There's just so many things \\
    That I can't touch \\
    I'm torn \\

    Torn... Ooooh... Hoo ooooh... Ooooh

    \couplet{pré refrain 3}

    There's nothing where he used to lie \\
    My inspiration has run dry \\
    That's what's going on \\
    Nothing's fine I'm torn \\


    \couplet{refrain 3}

    I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel \\
    I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor \\
    Illusion never changed, into something real \\
    I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn \\
    I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel \\
    I'm cold and I am shamed, bound and broken on the floor \\
    You're a little late, I'm already torn \\


    \couplet{Outro}

    Torn...  (much wailing)

    Fade out: grille du chorus
