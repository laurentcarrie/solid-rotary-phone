couplet 1

    | Well, she was just seventeen

    | Was way beyond compare
    | So how could I dance with another
    | Ooh, when I saw her standing there?

couplet 2

    | Well, she looked at me
    | And I, I could see
    | That before too long
    | I\'d fall in love with her
    | She wouldn\'t dance with another
    | Ooh, when I saw her standing there

    | Well, my heart went "boom"
    | When I crossed that room
    | And I held her hand in mine

couplet 3

    | Oh we danced through the night

    | Ooh, since I saw her standing there
