couplet 1

    | Well, she was just seventeen
    | You know what I mean
    | And the way she looked
    | Was way beyond compare
    | So how could I dance with another
    | Ooh, when I saw her standing there?

couplet 2

    | Well, she looked at me
    | And I, I could see
    | That before too long
    | I\'d fall in love with her
    | She wouldn\'t dance with another
    | Ooh, when I saw her standing there

refrain 1

    | Well, my heart went "boom"
    | When I crossed that room
    | And I held her hand in mine

couplet 3

    | Oh we danced through the night
    | And we held each other tight
    | And before too long
    | I fell in love with her
    | Now I\'ll never dance with another
    | Ooh, since I saw her standing there

refrain 2

    | Well, my heart went, "Boom"
    | When I crossed that room
    | And I held her hand in mine
    | Oh, we danced through the night
    | And we held each other tight
    | And before too long
    | I fell in love with her
    | Now I\'ll never dance with another
    | Oh, since I saw her standing there

outtro

    | Oh, since I saw her standing there
