Birds flying high, you know how I feel \\
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel \\
Breeze drifting on by, you know how I feel\\
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life...for me\\
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel\\
River running free, you know how I feel\\
Blossom in the trees, you know how I feel\\
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life..  .for me\\
And I'm feeling good

Dragonflies out in the sun, you know what I mean, don't you know\\
Butterflies all having fun, you know what I mean\\
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean\\
It's and old world, it's a new world, it's a bold world...  for me

Stars when you shine, you know how I feel\\
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel\\
Oh freedom is mine, and I know how I feel\\
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life...for me\\
And I'm feeling good
